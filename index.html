    <p><span class="lead">Heya, I'm Greg,</span> a web programmer in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee">Chattanooga, TN</a>.</p>

    <p>I believe software should be <strong>cleanly-designed</strong>, <strong>informative</strong>, and <strong>responsive</strong>. I'm a huge believer in building custom solutions, and I strive to do so when the alternative would lead to an unsatisfactory end product.</p>

    <p>I don't consider myself a graphic designer; I probably won't design your logo or other branding. However, I do design clean, minimal pages and widgets tailored to your existing brand. I'm also very comfortable working with professional designers and existing design documents to make sure your website or application is as appealing as possible.</p>

    <p>Need a website promoting your small business? Or, maybe you need a combination blog/shop? Perhaps you'd finally like to make that awesome app idea a reality? <strong>Reach out to me <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">in an email</a></strong> and let's talk.</p>
