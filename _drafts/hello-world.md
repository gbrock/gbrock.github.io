As a web developer, I've always relied on a global network of problem-solvers (read: when I come across a problem, I [search](http://google.com) for others' solutions and glean their delicious knowledge).

I have been aided time and time again by these works of others (usually blog posts, forum threads, and [SO answers](http://stackoverflow.com)) who record their work for posterity, so now I'd like to try to contribute meaningfully to the noise without simply adding to it.

I will attempt to catalog here whatever know-how and resources I find useful and/or effective.  Every effort will be made to present applicable facts, thorough reasoning, and cited sources.  Sometimes, posts will be tutorials;  I may try to teach you something, but I intend to learn a thing or two along the way.  At times, I will wax eloquent.

*However*, I'll sometimes use this as a personal space to write about whatever suits me and my interests.  While I do anticipate most of my posts will be programming-related, the occasional rant, review, tribute, and/or fluff piece may get published.

So, I'll be writing about web development, mostly.
