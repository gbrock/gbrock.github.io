This wasn't a personal project or school assignment; I had taken a job at a local startup with the shared understand that, while I was new at making websites, I was probably smart enough to learn.  I had little more experience than slicing up a .PSD into an HTML table but I was intent on becoming a web developer.  With opportunity secured, I set out to learn how to make "real websites".

Based on a recommendation, I looked into the PHP framework [CodeIgniter](http://www.codeigniter.com/).  Impressed by how easy it made certain tasks, I set out reading the documentation, learning about MVC architecture, Sessions, Databases, and other concepts which were new to me.  Before long, I happened upon and started following an excellent series by Jeffrey Way: 
[CodeIgniter From Scratch](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/codeigniter-from-scratch-day-1--net-5812).  This series **really** made sense to me, and after completing it, I was able to start coding my own application.

I've been using CodeIgniter professionally for the last five years and produced at least two dozen projects on the framework.  In many ways, it started my career; I owe my livelihood in part to its creators and community.
